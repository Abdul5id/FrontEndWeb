# A simple introduction to JavaScript and the DOM

*Clone* this repository using `git clone https://github.com/CTEC3905/javascript-01.git` instead of just downloading it. Before you push, you will need to change the GIT remote to your own repository for this code with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

This exercise introduces a few fundamental Javascript principles: *self-executing functions*, *event listeners* and *DOM manipulation* (changing HTML elements and/or their properties).

Read through the comments in the code and try out the suggestions.
